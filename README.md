# Wine Quality Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using supervised learning techniques. The dataset used for this analysis is the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Two machine learning models, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor, are applied to the dataset to compare their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset, which includes the following features:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)
